Binary Search Algorithm:-

Step 1 - Read the search element from the user.
Step 2 - Find the middle element in the sorted list.
Step 3 - Compare the search element with the middle element in the sorted list.
Step 4 - If both are matched, then display "Given element is found!!!" and terminate the function.
Step 5 - If both are not matched, then check whether the search element is smaller or larger than the middle element.
Step 6 - If the search element is smaller than middle element, repeat steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the left sublist of the middle element.
Step 7 - If the search element is larger than middle element, repeat steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the right sublist of the middle element.
Step 8 - Repeat the same process until we find the search element in the list or until sublist contains only one element.
Step 9 - If that element also doesn't match with the search element, then display "Element is not found in the list!!!" and terminate the function.
